- Give commands as prompted.
- Smart WhatsApp/Email messages: Edit generated content in Notepad before sending.

## Security

- <strong><span style="color:#c0392b">API keys and passwords must be kept in <code>.env</code> ‚Äî do NOT commit this file to the repository.</span></strong>

- `.env` is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Dependencies

- `speech_recognition` ‚Äì voice recognition
- `pyttsx3` ‚Äì text-to-speech

- AI-powered features need valid API keys.

## What Gravies can do

Gravies is built to be a flexible assistant you can interact with by voice or text. Key capabilities include:

- System control: open apps, folders and files; shutdown, restart, and log off the machine.
- Search and browsing: search the web or YouTube and open results in your browser.
- Media control: play, pause and control music or media players.
- Communication: send WhatsApp messages (via automation) and send emails (supports editing generated text before sending).
- Information: fetch weather, latest news, and Wikipedia summaries.
- Assistance: tell jokes, define words, and return AI-generated answers or suggestions.
- Automation hooks: scriptable actions using OS commands and GUI automation.


Discovering commands and examples

When you call the help command in interactive mode, Gravies will list supported commands and often show example usage (for example: "send whatsapp message", "open chrome", "play music", "get weather in London"). Use these examples as a starting point and adapt them to your needs.

Editing generated messages

If Gravies generates an email or WhatsApp message for you, it may open Notepad (or your default editor) so you can review and edit the content before sending. This is helpful for personalization and accuracy.
